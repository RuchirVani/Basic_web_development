        My parents established the Indian Institute of Computer Information (the first computer institute in our town even before I was born). 
        Therefore, computer was my first toy to play with. Consequently, I had more time to spare and play with computers. Thus, my interest in computers grew constantly.
        In my early school days, I learnt languages like logo and basic. I kept doing new things in the class and remained a frontrunner always. 
        In the high-school, I achieved mastery over languages like C and HTML. Along with that,
        I prepared innovative projects in math and science which are exhibited for guidance in the library even today. 
        Also, I never miss a chance to participate in seminars or projects organized in our zone. I have received many certificates and won many prizes in this area too.
        I have participated in seminars on hacking, graphics, etc. and won prizes in game making contests.I successfully led my group in preparing the Attendance project of our college. 
        I was runner up in Game Development in national level technical fest (COGNIZANT) which was held at Charusat University, Changa. 
        <p> Besides study, I am interested in social service and sports. I was the captain of my college volley-ball team.</P>
