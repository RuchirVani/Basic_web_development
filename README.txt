Personal Website (Ruchir Vani)
<-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
I have made the website with personal details and lease calculator.
Url for the wesite is: http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~rvani/hw4/
To access my website you need username and password which is as below:
Username:ruchir
Password:rsvani92

In my personal website I have used HTML,CSS,javascript for the browser's calculations and have used php for the server side to connect with database.

To run the website on the local machine you should have xampp or wamp or Apache etc fro the php and database.

Limitations :
Website - when you try to run websites on the different machines with the different resolution the look-feel of the website changes.
In car-buy-lease calculator I have made some assumptions, like for the lease I have assumed that monthly payment would be like price/200 and and considered that 

residual value on base of 16% per year. 

Limitations Mobile application- It has not good GUI. It can compre only for the limited number of miles which I have provided.
